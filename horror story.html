        The Haunting Whispers<br><br>
        In the dead of night, a relentless storm raged outside, its howling winds echoing through the desolate woods. Alone in a creaking, century-old cottage, a person shivered beneath their quilt. They had moved here to escape their past, but tonight, it had returned.<br><br>
        As the clock struck midnight, faint, eerie whispers emanated from the shadows. They were dismissed as tricks of the imagination, but the whispers grew louder, more sinister. Panic gnawed at them as an icy hand grazed their shoulder.<br><br>
        Terrified, they darted out of bed, only to find the walls closing in on them. The room twisted and warped, and they stumbled into a hallway that seemed to stretch endlessly. Each step brought them deeper into a nightmarish labyrinth, where grotesque apparitions lurked.<br><br>
        Realizing they were trapped in a malevolent force's twisted game, there was no escape. The whispering voices grew deafening, and as they swarmed, they knew they were lost to the darkness forever.
